    <h3>Got like $4? then you too can eat!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Box of spaghetti</li>
        <li>Jar of pasta sauce or ketchup if you're already drunk</li>
        <li>Water, clean if possible</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water, especially if you couldn't get any that was clean</li>
        <li>Once boiling, add the pasta and stir occasionally for 9 minutes or 10 minutes if your teeth are weak</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, add pasta sauce to a small sauce pan and cook over low heat, stirring frequently to avoid being splashed by scalding hot sauce, unless you're into that, no judgement</li>
        <li>Drain pasta and add sauce</li>
        <li>Eat directly from the pan like a rat</li>
    </ol>
