        <li>The cheapest ramen you can find</li>
        <li>The included seasoning packet</li>
        <li>The cleanest water you can find</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get out your only sauce pan</li>
        <li>Fill that bitch up with some clean water, if possible</li>
        <li>Boil that water to make it even cleaner</li>
        <li>Once boiling, quickly unwrap the ramen noodles but be sure to spill crumbs everywhere</li>
        <li>Throw that sad square of carbs into the boiling water</li>
        <li>Wait, you god damn animal, for two minutes</li>
        <li>Struggle to open the seasoning packet but eventually pour it all in the pan and stir for an additional minute</li>
